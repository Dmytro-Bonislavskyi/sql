# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model
Dmytro Bonislavskyi

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

## Type 1 - Overwrites Changes
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (
    customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    address_id INTEGER,
    full_address TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    province TEXT,
    zip_code TEXT,
    last_updated DATE
);

## Type 2 - Retains Changes
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (
    address_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    full_address TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    province TEXT,
    zip_code TEXT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    current_flag BOOLEAN
);


Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?

We didn`t made any masking or anonymizing, but, we separated client Names and Address to different tables, so we can apply access control policies to Address table to prevent unauthorized queries.
Also it would be nice to keep audit logs.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?

## 1. 
AdventureWorks is organized into 6 distinct logical schemas, offering a foundation for implementing access control measures. This approach is beneficial not only for large databases but also for smaller ones, ensuring scalability as needs evolve over time.

## 2. 
In contrast to AdventureWorks, my bookstore database relies on simple and direct relationships connecting sales, customers, and employees. While AdventureWorks navigates through intricate relationships, my database prioritizes straightforward connections, enhancing clarity and ease of management.
